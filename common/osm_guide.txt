OSM is a collaborative project for world mapping using data from various sources and volunteers. In GAIA you can get, use and explore different OSM-provided maps with different additional functions. 

Basically you don't need to do any things out of GAIA to start researching using OpenStreetMap. You can just select the OpenStreetMap source and start researching.
