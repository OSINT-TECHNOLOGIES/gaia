Using GAIA you can get and research Google Earth Engine datasets and OSM maps in one place without coding knowledges because of user-friendly Mercury-based UI.

To start researching you need to:

1) Register on Google Earth Engine using your Google account (https://code.earthengine.google.com/register) OR press "Create GEE account" button in dashboard
2) Register a new project with unpaid usage, choose any type of project you want and name it however you want 
3) Confirm everything you've chosen
4) Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/ and create service account for your project OR press "Create & Manage GEE service account" button in dashboard.
5) Once service account created, click the menu for that account, then Create key > JSON. Download the JSON key file and put it in GAIA directory
6) That's it! If you don't see any errors and see the map - congratulations, you've just finished Google EE connection procedure. Now you can start using GAIA with Google EE. 
7) You don't need to do anything for researching with OSM, but you need to complete previous steps to enter Combined Cartography and Satellite Imagery Module.
