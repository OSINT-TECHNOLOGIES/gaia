GAIA - Geospatial &amp; Aerial Images Analyser

~ Welcome to GAIA - Geospatial & Aerial Images Analyser [BETA] ~

*This program solution is not final and some details are potentially to be changed*

*New filters may be added to this program soon or later*

~ First steps to start ~

1) Open PATH.txt file in the directory of GAIA and past here the path to your folder with images which you want to analyze Ex: C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\GAIA\\IMAGES\\
**IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE 2 BACK-SLASHES**

2) Start program using one of these ways: 
  a) use start.bat file (it’ll start Jupyter Notebook server on localhost:8888 and program will be opened in your browser) 
  b) open GAIA.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook IDE (DataSpell works well and program was tested in it)
  
3) Start the program using “Run All” button

4) Enter the name of image which you want to analyze

5) Get the result!

6) If you want to change the way some filter work - go to pre-config cell and change it however you want (original config file is located in the GAIA folder)
